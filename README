Final Project: Pong

This program is our version of the classic game Pong. Our game was not built ontop of existing code, it was made strictly from scratch
with the small exception stated in the Code Referenced below.
Libraries were included however to allow utilization of the Arduino and the display.

To upload:
In the terminal, move to the directory where the Makefile and Pong.cpp file is located. Once there, ensure the Arduino is correctly
plugged into your PC. Upload the program using the "make upload" command. If there are issues uploadin the file, reconnect and ensure
the Arduino is plugged in and recognized. When the upload is sucessful, play may begin.

To play:
Use the Player 1 joystick to select "Single Player", or "Two Player." Once one is selected by pressing down on the Player 1
joystick, a message will display with a brief explanation of the game. Pressing the joystick down again will begin the game. The game is
now played until the pre-determined maximum score is reached.

Paddle Contatc Locations:
Below is a graphic showing what will happen to the y velocity of the ball based on the loaction it contacts the paddle.

            |   |_Fastest
            |   |_Faster
Paddle      |   |_Fast
Contact     |   |_*Contacting exactly in the middle (between both the "Fast" markers) will result in the ball having a y velocity of 0.
